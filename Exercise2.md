# Grilled Nutella Toast Recipe

## Ingredients: Bread, Hazeulnut Spread (nut-free Nutella), Butter

- Make the Nutella sandwich
  
  **Make it on fresh bread, no need to toast it first.**
- Butter both sides
  
  Room temperature butter is easier to spread on fresh bread. **You could also use spray in a pinch.**
- Grill it
  
  **Heat a non-sticking pan over medium-high heat.** Once hot, place the sandwich on the pan. Grill it until golden on one side and then on the other side.
- Your grilled nutella toast is ready to serve!
